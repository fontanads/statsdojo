    "# Suitable Modeling Approaches:\n",
    "Because the metric involves a mix of discrete (conversion) and continuous (transaction value) components, you should consider a two-part model to account for these different aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Zero-Inflated or Hurdle Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Since not all users make purchases, there are many zero-revenue users, and you need to account for this excess of zeros. Two popular approaches to handle this are zero-inflated models or hurdle models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Zero-Inflated Model: \n",
    "\n",
    "This model assumes that users come from two latent groups — those who will never make a purchase and those who may or may not make a purchase, based on some probability. In this case, the revenue per user is modeled as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{Revenue per User}=0)=(\\text{Probability of no purchase group}) + (\\text{Probability of purchase group but no purchase})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The second group, if they do make a purchase, follows a continuous distribution for the transaction value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hurdle Model:  \n",
    "This model assumes that all zeros come from users who do not convert (i.e., they do not \"pass the hurdle\" of making a purchase), and once users convert, their transaction values follow a continuous distribution (e.g., Gamma or Log-Normal). The hurdle is passed with some probability, and the distribution of revenue applies only to users who have converted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Log-Normal or Gamma for Transaction Value (Non-Zero Revenue)\n",
    "\n",
    "For users who make a purchase, the transaction value (revenue per user) is continuous, positive, and unbounded, but skewed (with some users potentially making very large purchases). Two common distributions for modeling such data are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Log-Normal Distribution:  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good candidate when the revenue is positively skewed and the log of the transaction value is normally distributed.  \n",
    "The Log-Normal distribution handles unbounded positive data and allows for long tails, which could accommodate a few users making very large purchases.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Revenue} \\sim \\log-\\text{Normal}(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gamma Distribution: \n",
    "The Gamma distribution is another suitable choice for modeling positive, continuous data, especially when the data is skewed.  \n",
    "Like the Log-Normal, the Gamma distribution handles unbounded positive data and can be parameterized with a shape and rate (or scale) parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Revenue} \\sim \\text{Gamma}(\\alpha, \\beta)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two-Part Model (Combining Discrete and Continuous Parts)\n",
    "A two-part model combines the discrete conversion probability and the continuous transaction value for those who convert. For example:  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1: Conversion Probability: \n",
    "You can model the probability of conversion (purchase) using a Bernoulli or Logistic Regression model, which would predict whether a user converts or not:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Conversion}\\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $p$ is the probability that a user makes a purchase.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: Transaction Value:   \n",
    "\n",
    "For users who do convert, model the non-zero transaction value using either a Gamma or Log-Normal distribution, as discussed above.  \n",
    "The overall likelihood can then be constructed as a combination of these two parts:\n",
